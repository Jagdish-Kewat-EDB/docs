title: Managing Superset Access
---

You control access to Superset data sources by Superset roles and permissions. Learn more about Superset roles, users, and permissions management in [Superset Security](https://superset.apache.org/docs/security). To assign Superset permissions to the EDB Cloud user role, see [Changing Role Permissions](01_portal_access/#changing-role-permissions).

EDB Cloud users can be granted the following special permissions:

* superset:admin
* superset:alpha
* superset:gamma (granted by default)

These EDB Cloud permissions translate to Superset roles as follows:


| User Superset Role  | Permissions Included in EDB Cloud User Role                                         | Superset Privileges                                                                    |
