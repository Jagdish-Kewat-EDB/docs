title: "Analyzing Your Data with Apache Superset"
---
You can use Apache Superset to analyze, explore, and visualize data stored in your PostgreSQL clusters.
If you are logged in to EDB Cloud and have permissions to access Superset, you can open Apache Superset using one of **Analyze** links.

!!! Note
    Apache Superset shares Single Sign On with EDB Cloud. If you log out of Superset you will be logged out of EDB Cloud and vice-versa.


## Connecting Superset to your Cluster




You will need your host and port to connect to Superset. To find the host and port of your cluster:

1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com/) portal.

3. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters) page.
4. Select the name of your cluster.
5. Select the **Connect** tab and find **Host** and **Port**.


To create a connection to an EDB Cloud cluster:

1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com/) portal.

2. Navigate to **Analyze > Connections**.
3. Select the **+ Database** button on top right. This will open a dialog box.
4. Enter a value for **DATABASE NAME**.
5. Enter the connection string for your cluster as **SQLALCHEMY URI**, in the following format:

    `postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{database}?sslmode=require`

7. Check the connection using the **TEST CONNECTION** button and add it if the connection was successful.

For more information on connecting to Superset, see:
- [Superset documentation on connecting to Postgres](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/postgres#postgres).
- [Connecting Superset to a new database](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/first-dashboard#connecting-to-a-new-database) since connecting Superset to a EDB Cloud cluster is similar to connecting to a new database.

Upon successful connection, you are good to add datasets, charts, and dashboards.


## Using Superset Dashboards

You can use Superset dashboards to analyze data stored in your cluster. For a tutorial on creating a simple dashboard, see [Creating Your First Dashboard](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/first-dashboard).

To view all available Superset dashboards, navigate to **Analyze > Dashboards**.


## Using Superset Charts

You can use Superset charts to visualize data stored in your cluster. See the [Superset documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/exploring-data) for instructions and examples of creating Superset charts.

To view all available Superset charts, navigate to **Analyze > Charts**.


## Using  Superset SQL Lab

You can use Superset SQL Lab to write queries to access and modify data stored in your cluster. To access SQL Lab, navigate to **Analyze > SQL Editor**.


##  Superset Permissions

Access to Superset data sources is controlled by Superset roles. Learn more about superset roles, users and permissions management in [Superset Security](https://superset.apache.org/docs/security).

EDB Cloud users can be granted the following special permissions:

* superset:admin
* superset:alpha
* superset:gamma

These EDB Cloud permissions translate to Superset roles as follows:


| User Superset Role  | EDB Cloud User Role                                         | Superset Privileges                                                                    |
| --------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gamma               | Has _superset:gamma_ or no any superset related permissions |  View data they granted access to, can create dashboards          |
| Alpha               |  Include _superset:alpha_ permission                        | Gamma privileges +add or alter data sources                       |
| Admin               |  Include _superset:admin_ permission                        | Alpha privileges + grant or revoke access to data to other users  |


You can control access to Superset by assigning superset permissions to EDB Cloud user roles. See [Changing Role Permissions](../administering_cluster/01_portal_access/#changing-role-permissions).
