title: "Analyzing Your Data with Apache Superset"
---
You can use Apache Superset to analyze, explore, and visualize data stored in your PostgreSQL clusters.
You can open Superset from the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com/) portal using the **Analyze** links. 

Default permissions include the ability to view data and create dashboards. To add or alter data sources, you need additional permissions. For more information on permissions to access Superset, see [Managing Superset Access](../administering_cluster/01a_superset_access).

!!! Note
    Apache Superset shares Single Sign On with EDB Cloud. If you log out of Superset you will be logged out of EDB Cloud and vice-versa.


## Connecting Superset to your Cluster




In addition to your password, you need your user, host, port, and database name to connect to Superset. To find this additional information for your cluster:

1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com/) portal.

3. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters) page.
4. Select the name of your cluster.
5. Select the **Connect** tab.


To create a connection to an EDB Cloud cluster:

1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com/) portal.

2. Navigate to **Analyze > Connections**.
3. Select **+ Database** to open the **Add database** dialog box.
4. Enter a value for **DATABASE NAME**.
5. Enter the connection string for your cluster in the **SQLALCHEMY URI** field, using the following format:

    `postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{dbname}?sslmode=verify-full`

7. Check the connection by selecting **TEST CONNECTION**. Select **ADD** if the connection was successful.

For more information on connecting to Superset, see:
- [Connecting Superset to a new database](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/first-dashboard#connecting-to-a-new-database) since connecting Superset to a EDB Cloud cluster is similar to connecting to a new database.
- [Superset documentation on connecting to Postgres](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/postgres#postgres).


Upon successful connection, you can add datasets, charts, and dashboards.


## Using Superset Dashboards

You can use Superset dashboards to analyze data stored in your cluster. For a tutorial on creating a simple dashboard, see [Creating Your First Dashboard](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/first-dashboard).

To view all available Superset dashboards, navigate to **Analyze > Dashboards**.


## Using Superset Charts

You can use Superset charts to visualize data stored in your cluster, see the [Superset documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/exploring-data) for instructions and examples of creating Superset charts.

To view all available Superset charts, navigate to **Analyze > Charts**.


## Using  Superset SQL Lab

You can use Superset SQL Lab to write queries to access and modify data stored in your cluster. To access SQL Lab, navigate to **Analyze > SQL Editor**.
